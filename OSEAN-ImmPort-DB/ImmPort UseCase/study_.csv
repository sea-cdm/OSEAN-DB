1,1089,,,,SDY10,,,Role of Antimicrobial Peptides in Host Defense Against Vaccinia Virus (AMP 01),"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by recurrent viral skin infections. Recent studies have demonstrated that the skin of people with AD my have decreased antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression. The purpose of this study is to compare small pox virus replication and the number of AMPs and other antiviral molecules in people with AD, as compared to those seen in people with psoriasis or asthma, or healthy individuals."
2,2815,,,,SDY100,,,PPARG and microRNA-146 in mucosal immune responses to C. difficile,"Clostridium difficile is typically a harmless anaerobic bacterium but recently it has re-emerged as a facultative pathogen that can cause nosocomial diarrhea, colitis and even death. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma has been implicated in the prevention of inflammation in autoimmune and infectious diseases; however, its role in the immunoregulatory mechanisms modulating host responses to C. difficile remains largely unknown. To characterize the role of PPAR gamma in C. difficile-associated disease (CDAD), immunity and gut pathology, we used a mouse model of C. difficile infection in wild-type and T cell-specific PPAR gamma null mice. The loss of PPAR gamma in T cells increased disease activity and colonic inflammatory lesions following C. difficile infection. Colonic expression of IL-17 was upregulated and IL-10 downregulated in colons of T cell-specific PPAR gamma null mice. Also, both the loss of PPAR gamma in T cells and C. difficile infection favored Th17 responses in spleen and colonic lamina propria of mice with CDAD. MicroRNA (miRNA)-sequencing analysis and RT-PCR validation indicated that miR-146b was significantly overexpressed in colons of C. difficile-infected mice. We next developed a computational model that predicts the upregulation of miR-146b, downregulation of the PPAR gamma co-activator NCOA4, and PPAR gamma, leading to upregulation of IL-17. Treatment of C. difficile-infected mice with the PPAR gamma agonist pioglitazone ameliorated colitis and suppressed pro-inflammatory gene expression. In conclusion, our data indicates that miRNA-146b and PPAR gamma may be implicated in the regulation of Th17 responses and colitis in C. difficile-infected mice."

18,5643,,,,SDY1093,,,Apc Restoration in Colorectal Cancer,"The Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) tumor suppressor is mutated in the vast majority of human colorectal cancers (CRC) and leads to deregulated Wnt signaling. To determine whether Apc disruption is required for tumor maintenance, we developed a mouse model of CRC whereby Apc can be conditionally suppressed using a doxycycline-regulated shRNA. Apc suppression produces adenomas in both the small intestine and colon that, in the presence of Kras and p53 mutations, can progress to invasive carcinoma. In established tumors, Apc restoration drives rapid and widespread tumor-cell differentiation and sustained regression without relapse. Tumor regression is accompanied by the re-establishment of normal crypt-villus homeostasis, such that once aberrantly proliferating cells reacquire self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation capability. Our study reveals that CRC cells can revert to functioning normal cells given appropriate signals, and provide compelling in vivo validation of the Wnt pathway as a therapeutic target for treatment of CRC"

22,5595,,,,SDY1099,,,DNMT3A Haploinsufficiency Transforms FLT3 ITD Myeloproliferative Disease into AML,"Cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) represents nearly 50% of human AML. Co-occurring mutations in the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and the FMS related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) are common in CN-AML and confer a poorer prognosis, but the molecular mechnism of the double-mutant is unknown. By using a rapid mouse model of FLT3/DNMT3A-Mutant AML and advanced global scRNAseq and methylation profiling techniques, the study demonstrates that DNMT3A haploinsufficiency results in reversible epigenetic alterations that transform FLT3 ITD -mutant myeloproliferative neoplasm into AML."
23,2815,,,,SDY110,,,Immune responses to Helicobacter pylori in a pig model,"Helicobacter pylori infection is the leading cause for peptic ulcer disease and gastric adenocarcinoma. Mucosal T cell responses play an important role in mediating H. pylori-related gastric immunopathology. While induced regulatory T (iTreg) cells are required for chronic colonization without disease, Th1 effector responses are associated with lower bacterial load at the expense of gastric pathology. With the objective of developing a large animal model of H. pylori infection, pigs were inoculated with either H. pylori strain SS1 or J99. Changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell populations were monitored weekly, and mucosal immune responses and bacterial loads were assessed at day 57 post-infection. Both H. pylori strains elicited a Th1 response with increased percentage of CD4+Tbet+ cells and elevated Tbet and IFN-. mRNA in PBMC. A subset of CD8beta+ T cells and B cells expressing Tbet increased due to infection. Moreover, a significant increase of NK cells was observed in infected pigs pointing towards a predominant cytotoxic immune response. Infiltration of cytotoxic cells was detected in the gastric lamina propria of both infected groups. Interestingly, strain J99 evoked a more dramatic acute response associated with lower bacterial loads, while strain SS1 showed longer-term colonization capacity. This novel pig model of infection closely mimics human gastric pathology and presents a suitable avenue for studying the cytotoxic and regulatory responses towards H. pylori described in humans."

45,5880,,,,SDY1176,,,Extensive homeostatic T cell phenotypic variation within the Collaborative Cross,"The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a panel of reproducible recombinant inbred mouse strains with high levels of standing genetic variation, thereby affording unprecedented opportunity to perform experiments in a small animal model containing controlled genetic diversity while allowing for genetic replicates. Here, we advance the utility of this unique mouse resource for immunology research, as it allows for both examination and genetic dissection of mechanisms behind adaptive immune states in mice with distinct and defined genetic makeups. This approach is founded on quantitative trait locus mapping: identifying genetically variant genome regions associated with phenotypic variance in traits-of-interest. Furthermore, the CC can be utilized for mouse model development; distinct strains have unique immunophenotypes and immune properties, making them suitable for research on particular diseases and infections. Here, we describe variation in cellular immune phenotypes across F1 crosses of CC strains, and reveal novel quantitative trait loci responsible for several immune phenotypes."

53,4009,,,,SDY1215,,,Mitochondrial and Nuclear Ancestry Association to PTB,"Genome-wide genotyping studies of cohorts of preterm and term individuals were evaluated. Mitochondrial haplogroup and nuclear ancestry for individuals were determined and used to develop a scoring for the degree to which mitochondrial ancestry is divergent from nuclear ancestry. Infants with higher degrees of divergent mitochondrial ancestry were at increased risk for preterm birth (0.124 for preterm vs 0.105 for term infants; P < .05). This finding was validated in 1 of 2 replication cohorts. Greater degrees of divergent ancestry correlating with earlier delivery within the primary study population was observed, but this finding was not replicated in secondary cohorts born preterm. Individuals with divergent patterns of mitochondrial and nuclear ancestry are at increased risk for preterm birth. These findings may in part explain the higher rates of preterm birth in African Americans and in individuals with a matrilineal family history of preterm birth."

57,5597,,,,SDY1249,,,Whole tumor RNA-sequencing and deconvolution of glioma transcriptional signature,"Using whole tumor RNA-sequencing and mathematical deconvolution strategies to characterize low-grade glioma exosystem of several preclinical mouse models of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) optic glioma, a low-grade astrocytoma whose formation and maintenance requires productive interactions between non-neoplastic and neoplastic cells. The result demonstrate that optic gliomas generated by altering the germline Nf1 gene mutation, the glioma cell of origin, or the presence of co-existing genetic alterations represent molecularly-distinct tumors. However, these optic glioma tumors share a 25-gene core signature, not found in normal optic nerve, that is normalized by microglia inhibition (minocycline), but not conventional (carboplatin) or molecularly-targeted (rapamycin) chemotherapy. In addition, a genetic signature conferred by Pten reduction and corrected by PI3K inhibition was identified, which predicts progression-free survival in patients with either low-grade or high-grade glioma. Collectively, these findings support the concept that gliomas are composite ecological systems whose biology and response to therapy may be best defined by examining the tumor as a whole."

Here we have used a systems biology approach to identify early gene signatures that predicted immune responses in humans vaccinated with yellow fever vaccine YF-17D. Vaccination induced genes that regulate virus innate sensing and type I interferon production. Computational analyses identified a gene signature, including complement protein C1qB and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4, an orchestrator of the integrated stress response that correlated with and predicted YF-17D CD8+ T cell responses with up to 90% accuracy in an independent, blinded trial.

100,6254,,,,SDY1381,,,Host Determinants Of Protection Against Tuberculosis In Adolescents,"The bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), has infected one quarter of the world's population. Infection occurs when the pathogen is inhaled, following exposure to a patient with lung TB. 10% of infected persons progress to disease, while 90% never do. We don't understand why some people develop disease, while others do not: this is the focus of this application. To address protection against TB, we have established a cohort of 6,363 South African adolescents. 53% were infected with M.tb at baseline. During 2 years of follow-up, 76 of these participants developed TB disease. As blood was collected and stored every 6 months, we have a unique opportunity to compare host responses between adolescents who developed disease and those who have remained healthy. We will have two approaches to defining protection. Our first focus will be on T cells, which are immune cells shown to be critical for protection against TB. Current assays focus on limited aspects of the T cell response, but have not been successful in defining protection. We have devised a new paradigm - we hypothesize that a model including multiple T cell functional attributes plus their regulation by multiple immune cells will define protection. We propose that relative ""immune quiescence"", i.e., an optimal but relatively silent immune response, is associated with protection. We and others have preliminary data to suggest that too much inflammation, or too much activation of the immune system, may be detrimental. The rationale for our second focus is that our knowledge of host control of M.tb infection remains incomplete - we therefore propose an unbiased approach that will facilitate discovery of novel pathways involved in protection. We will assess genome-wide gene expression in blood cells, including purified immune cell populations, to delineate new pathways involved in protection. Our preliminary studies of protection against TB in infants have shown the incredible power of this approach. The longitudinal nature of the adolescent cohort, and state-of-the-art bioinformatic approaches, afford unique muscle for uncovering host determinants of protection. We will immediately validate findings by studying further groups of adolescents, from the same cohort. This will be followed by mechanistic studies aimed at understanding how newly described markers may act to protect us against TB. Knowledge of host determinants of protection against TB disease could impact TB control in many ways. For example, targeted prophylactic therapy for infected persons could be implemented, as well as rapid clinical testing of novel TB vaccines. Knowledge gained will also stimulate development of new vaccines and drugs against TB."

104,2014,,,,SDY139,,,The peptide specificity of the endogenous T follicular helper cell repertoire generated after protein immunization,"T follicular helper (Tfh) cells potentiate high-affinity, class-switched antibody responses, the predominant correlate of protection from vaccines. Despite intense interest in understanding both the generation and effector functions of this lineage, little is known about the epitope specificity of Tfh cells generated during polyclonal responses. To date, studies of peptide-specific Tfh cells have relied on either the transfer of TcR transgenic cells or use of peptide:MHC class II tetramers and antibodies to stain TcR and follow limited peptide specificities. In order to comprehensively evaluate polyclonal responses generated from the natural endogenous TcR repertoire, we developed a sorting strategy to separate Tfh cells from non-Tfh cells and found that their epitope-specific responses could be tracked with cytokine-specific ELISPOT assays. The immunodominance hierarchies of Tfh and non-Tfh cells generated in response to immunization with several unrelated protein antigens were remarkably similar. Additionally, increasing the kinetic stability of peptide-MHC class II complexes enhanced the priming of both Tfh and conventional CD4 T cells. These findings may provide us with a strategy to rationally and selectively modulate epitope-specific Tfh responses. By understanding the parameters that control epitope-specific priming, vaccines may be tailored to enhance or focus Tfh responses to facilitate optimal B cell responses."

139,2014,,,,SDY147,,,Analyses of the specificity of CD4 T Cells during the primary immune response to influenza virus reveals dramatic MHC-linked asymmetries in reactivity to individual viral proteins,"Influenza is a contagious, acute respiratory disease that is a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. CD4 T cells play an important role in the immune response to this pathogen through the secretion of antiviral cytokines, and by providing help to CD8 T cells and B cells to promote the development of immunological memory and neutralizing antibody responses. Despite these well-defined roles in the anti-influenza response, our understanding of CD4 T-cell diversity and specificity remains limited. In the study reported here, overlapping peptides representing 5 different influenza viral proteins were used in EliSpot assays to enumerate and identify the specificity of anti-influenza CD4 T cells directly ex vivo following infection of mice with influenza virus, using two strains that express unrelated MHC class II molecules. These experiments evaluated whether the reactivity of CD4 T cells generally tracked with particular influenza proteins, or whether MHC preferences were the predominant factor dictating anti-CD4 T-cell specificity in the primary immune response. We made the unexpected discovery that the distribution of CD4 T-cell specificities for different influenza proteins varied significantly depending on the single class II molecule expressed in vivo. In SJL mice, the majority of epitopes were specific for the HA protein, while the NP protein dominated the response in C57BL/10 mice. Given the diversity of human MHC class II molecules, these findings have important implications for the ability to rationally design a vaccine that will generate a specific CD4 T-cell immune response that is effective across diverse human populations."

142,4009,,,,SDY1473,,,Whole exome sequencing reveals HSPA1L as a genetic risk factor for spontaneous preterm birth,"Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality, and prematurity is further associated with serious morbidities in later life. Genetic and environmental risk factors play a role in the susceptibility to preterm birth. Despite numerous studies, the genetic basis for preterm birth remains poorly defined. We investigated the presence of rare, possibly risk associated nucleotide variants in mothers with spontaneous preterm births (SPTB). The first set of mothers with family history of recurrent preterm births was of northern Finnish origin. An additional set of mothers (sister pairs, both giving birth preterm) of European origin was also studied. Whole exome sequencing identified multiple rare, likely damaging HSPA1L variants in several families affected by SPTB, and this gene was associated with the glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathway. Potential involvement of one of the HSPA1L variants in SPTB was further supported by large GWAS dataset. In addition, this variant alters protein post-translational modification potential, and thus may affect protein stability and its function as a chaperone."
143,4009,,,,SDY1474,,,Anthropoid primate specific retroviral element THE1B controls expression of CRH in placenta and alters gestation length,"The proper timing of delivery is critical during pregnancy; if too early or too late, the baby will be at risk of serious health problems and even death. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a protein that can be detected in maternal blood, and its concentration correlates with the timing of birth. In humans and other anthropoid primates, CRH is made by the placenta, whereas in other mammals, it is produced in a specialized region of the brain. To understand the regulation and evolution of this key protein, we inserted the human CRH gene and nearby regions into the mouse genome, which resulted in human CRH expression in the mouse placenta. Mouse litters that make CRH in their placentas are born later than control mice, showing that CRH can directly affect birth timing. Using our mouse model, we then selectively deleted a remnant of an ancient retrovirus that is normally found in the DNA of anthropoid primates and demonstrated that this specific region controls expression of CRH in the placenta. Deletion of this region also restored normal birth timing in the mice by eliminating CRH production from the placenta. We propose that retroviral regulation of CRH in the placenta may be a mechanism of controlling birth timing in humans and other anthropoid primates."

146,2815,,,,SDY148,,,The Role of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma in Immune Responses to Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli Infection,"Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is recognized as an emerging cause of persistent diarrhea and enteric disease worldwide. Mucosal immunity towards EAEC infections is incompletely understood;due in part to the lack of appropriate animal models. This study presents a new mouse model and investigates the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) in the modulation of host responses to EAEC in nourished and malnourished mice. Methods/Principal Findings: Wild-type and T cell-specific PPARg null C57BL/6 mice were fed protein-deficient diets at weaning and challenged with 5x10^9 cfu EAEC strain JM221 to measure colonic gene expression and immune responses to EAEC. Antigen-specific responses to E. coli antigens were measured in nourished and malnourished mice following infection and demonstrated the immunosuppressive effects of malnutrition at the cellular level. At the molecular level, both pharmacological blockade and deletion of PPARg in T cells resulted in upregulation of Tgfb1, IL-6, IL-17 and anti-microbial peptides, enhanced Th17 responses, fewer colonic lesions, faster clearance of EAEC, and improved recovery. The beneficial effects of PPAR gamma blockade on weight loss and EAEC clearance were abrogated by neutralizing IL-17 in vivo. Conclusions: Our studies provide in vivo evidence in support of supporting the beneficial role of mucosal innate and effector T cell responses on the EAEC burden and suggest pharmacological blockade of PPARg as a novel therapeutic intervention for EAEC infection.

164,1885,,,,SDY1521,,,Memory B Cells with cross-reactive Abs to fluA(H1-H3),"To understand how the humoral immune system generates and matures protective responses to influenza virus infections and vaccinations. The group isolated B membory single cell clones from three unrelated, adult donors post TIV-vaccination, characterized the cross-reacting Abs to fluA (H1-H3) antigens, and generated the VDJ lineage tree of Bmem clones from one donor. The lineage and crystal structure analysis showed that members of a lineage had a BCR structure similar to that of a previously described Ab, encoded by different gene segments. Comparison showed that both Abs contacted the HA receptor-binding site through long heavy-chain third complementarity determining regions (HCDR3). Affinities of the clonal-lineage BCRs for historical influenza-virus HAs from both group 1 (H1) and group 2 (H3) viruses suggested that serial responses to seasonal influenza exposures had elicited the lineage and driven affinity maturation."
165,6402,,,,SDY1522,,,Longitudinal study to common vaccines,"Goal: To understand the longevity of humoral immune protection and the role played by memory B cells after common vaccinations. To quantify the heterogeneity in antibody responses to different vaccines and viruses. To quantify the time to loss of protective immunity to each vaccine or virus at the population level. Methods: Performed longitudinal data analysis on antibody titers for viral antigens (vaccinia, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella-zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus) and nonreplicating antigens (tetanus and diphtheria) in 45 subjects for a period of up to 26 years. Used a mixed-effects modeling framework to characterize the heterogeneity in antibody responses and to determine how variation in the magnitude and decay rate affect how protective immunity is lost at the population level to different virus and vaccine antigens. Results: Antiviral antibody responses were remarkably stable, with half-lives ranging from an estimated 50 years for varicella-zoster virus to more than 200 years for other viruses such as measles and mumps. Antibody responses against tetanus and diphtheria antigens waned more quickly, with estimated half-lives of 11 years and 19 years, respectively. B-cell memory was long-lived, but there was no significant correlation between peripheral memory B-cell numbers and antibody levels for five of the eight antigens tested. The statistical analysis and models helped to stratify the heterogenity factors and quantified each in a single plot to view interplays of factors, such as the fast-decay of anti-nonreplicating-antigens is compensated for by the higher magnitude of responses (relative to the level for protection) which explains a higher fraction of vaccinated individuals have protective immunity to tetanus and diphtheria than to measles, rubella, and vaccinia in the first 4 decades, suggesting the need for reevaluation of their boosting schedules."
166,4009,,,,SDY1528,,,Preeclampsia Study,"Preeclampsia is one of the most severe pregnancy complications and a leading cause of maternal death. However, early diagnosis of preeclampsia remains a clinical challenge, only limited information of select immune cell subsets is available. The goal is to detect characteristic immune dysfunctions in the maternal blood prior to the clinical onset of preeclampsia. The study used a high-dimensional mass cytometry immunoassay to characterize the dynamic changes of over 370 immune cell features in maternal blood during healthy and preeclamptic pregnancies. Results: A set of eight cell-specific immune features that accurately predict the preeclampsia well before the clinical diagnosis is identified. Several features recapitulated previously known immune dysfunctions in preeclampsia, such as elevated pro-inflammatory innate immune responses early in pregnancy and impaired regulatory T (Treg) cell signaling. The analysis revealed additional novel immune responses that were strongly associated with, and preceded the onset of preeclampsia, notably abnormal STAT5ab signaling dynamics in CD4+T cell subsets (AUC 0.92, p = 8.0E-5). These results provide a global readout of the dynamics of the maternal immune system early in pregnancy and lay the groundwork for identifying clinically-relevant immune dysfunctions for the prediction and prevention of preeclampsia"

Mice intranasally challenged with Alternaria alternata, a fungal allergen associated with severe asthma and fatal exacerbations in humans, potently activates ILC2s via the IL-33/ST2 (IL-33R) axis to robustly secrete type 2 cytokines. Animal models, including Alternaria-induced lung inflammation in mice, have given us critical insight into pathways of ILC2 regulation that appear to apply to ILC2 responses in human disease.7 Thus, accurate identification of ILC2s in the lungs of mice is critical to future understanding of their biology and contribution to allergic disease.

182,6442,,,,SDY1597,,,Immune Cell Repertoires in Breast Cancer Patients after Adjuvant Chemotherapy,"Adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients causes immune cell depletion at an age when the regenerative capacity is compromised. Successful regeneration requires the recovery of both quantity and quality of immune cell subsets. Although immune cell numbers rebound within a year post-treatment, it is unclear whether overall compositional diversity is recovered. We investigated the regeneration of immune cell complexity by comparing peripheral blood mononuclear cells from breast cancer patients ranging from one to five years post-chemotherapy with those of age-matched healthy controls using mass cytometry and T cell receptor sequencing. These data revealed universal changes in patients' CD4 T cells that persisted for years and consisted of expansion of TH17-like CD4 memory populations with incomplete recovery of CD4 naive T cells. Conversely, CD8 T cells fully recovered within a year. Mechanisms of T cell regeneration however were unbiased as CD4 and CD8 T cell receptor diversity remained high. Likewise, TEMRAs were not expanded indicating that regeneration was not driven by recognition of latent viruses. These data suggest that while CD8 T cell immunity is successfully regenerated, the CD4 compartment may be irreversibly impacted. Moreover, the bias of CD4 memory towards inflammatory effector cells may impact responses to vaccination and infection."

184,6257,,,,SDY1599,,,Synovial fibroblast positional identity controlled by inductive Notch signaling underlies pathologic damage in inflammatory arthritis,"The synovium is a mesenchymal tissue composed mainly of fibroblasts with a lining and sublining that surrounds the joints. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the synovial tissue undergoes marked hyperplasia, becomes inflamed and invasive and destroys the joint1,2. Recently, we and others found that a subset of fibroblasts located in the sublining undergoes major expansion in RA and is linked to disease activity 35. However, the molecular mechanism by which these fibroblasts expand in RA remains unknown. Here, we identified a critical role for NOTCH3 signaling in the differentiation of perivascular and sublining CD90(THY1)+ fibroblasts. Using single cell RNA-sequencing and mixed cell micromass organoids, we found that NOTCH3 signaling drives both transcriptional and spatial gradients in fibroblasts emanating from vascular endothelial cells outward. In active RA, NOTCH3 and NOTCH target genes are markedly upregulated in synovial fibroblasts. Importantly, genetic deletion of Notch3 or monoclonal antibody-blockade of NOTCH3 signaling attenuates inflammation and prevents joint damage in inflammatory arthritis. Our results indicate that synovial fibroblasts exhibit positional identity regulated by endothelium-derived Notch signaling and that this stromal crosstalk pathway underlies inflammation and pathology in inflammatory arthritis."

One-year survival for patients with SSc-PAH ranges from 50-81%. There is currently no cure for SSc-PAH and treatment is limited to vasodilator therapy used in all forms of PAH. In recent studies, immunotherapy was shown to be effective in treating SSc-interstitial lung disease, another serious, life-threatening manifestation of SSc. In addition, there are compelling pre-clinical data and anecdotal clinical reports that suggest modulation of the immune system may be an effective strategy for treating SSc-PAH.

The result shows that PGR evolved rapidly in the human lineage (as well as other Catarrhine primates), which likely reflects an episode of relaxed selection intensity rather than positive selection. Coincident with the episode of relaxed selection intensity, ancestral sequence resurrection and functional tests indicate that the major human PR isoforms (PR-A and PR-B) evolved divergent functions in the human stem-lineage. These results suggest that the regulation of progesterone signaling by PR-A and PR-B may also have diverged in the human lineage and that non-human animal models of progesterone signaling may not faithfully recapitulate human biology"

And tested associations between these haplotype genetic scores and birth outcomes (gestational duration, birth weight). In addition, constructed the infant-specific birth weight genetic scores to examine the effects of fetal growth on gestational duration and maternal phenotypes during pregnancy. The conclusions of the study are that both maternal height and fetal growth are important factors in shaping the duration of gestation: genetically elevated maternal height is associated with longer gestational duration, whereas alleles that increase fetal growth are associated with shorter gestational duration. Fetal growth is influenced by both maternal and fetal effects and can reciprocally influence maternal phenotypes"

In the US, progesterone (P4) supplementation is the only FDA-approved drug for use in preventing recurrent spontaneous PTB. However, P4 has limited effectiveness (only 1/3 of cases). To identify repositioning drug candidates, the study used a rank-based pattern-matching strategy to compare the differential gene expression signature for PTB to differential gene expression drug profiles in the Connectivity Map database and assigned a reversal score to each PTB-drug pair. Eighty-three drugs, including P4, were identified. Many of these compounds have been evaluated in the context of pregnancy, with 13 belonging to pregnancy category A or B ? indicating no known risk in human pregnancy.

RESULTS: vaginal dysbiosis characterised by Lactobacillus spp. depletion was present prior to the rupture of fetal membranes in approximately a third of cases and persisted following membrane rupture. Vaginal dysbiosis was exacerbated by erythromycin treatment particularly in women initially colonised by Lactobacillus spp. Lactobacillus depletion and increased relative abundance of Sneathia spp. were associated with subsequent funisitis and early onset neonatal sepsis. This highlights vaginal microbiota as a potentially modifiable antenatal risk factor for PPROM and suggests that routine use of erythromycin for PPROM be re-examined."

Transcriptomic analyses revealed a unique expression signature for isPTB, which included three upregulated IGF binding proteins (IGFBP1, IGFBP2, and IGFBP6), supporting a role for aberrant IGF signaling in isPTB, and secondary signatures of inflammatory markers including TNC, C3, CFH, and C1R, which have been associated with placental maturity. In contrast, the expression signature of the PTB-infection cohort included upregulation of proliferative genes along with cell cycling and mitosis pathways.

Here, we performed multi-omic single-cell immune profiling of 64 COVID-19 patients across the full range of disease severity, from outpatients with mild disease to fatal cases. Our transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic analyses reveal widespread dysfunction of peripheral innate immunity in severe and fatal COVID-19, with the most profound disturbances including a prominent neutrophil hyperactivation signature and monocytes with anti-inflammatory features. We further demonstrate that emergency granulopoiesis is a prominent feature of fatal COVID-19. Notably, we do not identify substantial immune perturbations in mild COVID-19 in either protein expression, RNA expression, or chromatin regulation, implying that mild disease is characterized by absent or rapidly resolved systemic immune responses. Collectively, our results reveal disease severity-associated immune phenotypes in COVID-19 such as neutrophil hyperactivation that may provide targets for therapeutic intervention such as inhibiting neutrophil function through ligation of neutrophil inhibitory receptors."

For some bacterial taxa, physiologic encounters with the immune system are restricted to this inter- val, despite abundance of these taxa in the gut lumen at later times outside this interval. Antigen-specific tolerance to gut bacteria induced during this preweaning interval is stable and maintained even if these taxa are encountered later in life in an inflammatory setting. However, inhibiting microbial antigen encounter during this interval or ex- tending these encounters beyond the normal interval results in a failure to induce tolerance and robust antigen- specific effector responses to gut bacteria upon reencounter in an inflammatory setting. Thus, we have identified a defined preweaning interval critical for developing tolerance to gut bacteria and maintaining the mutually bene- ficial relationship with our gut microbiota."

255,4009,,,,SDY1732,,,Maternal gut microbiota reflecting poor diet quality is associated with sPTB,"The study conducted comparative analysis in case-control datasets on the data of fecal gut microbiota, fecal and plasma metabolites, and diet in the late second trimester. Results: 1) A decrease in α-diversity was strongly associated with the development of SPTB, especially in the taxonomic class of Betaproteobacteria. 2) Of 824 fecal metabolites, 22 metabolites (mostly lipids) differed between cases and controls (P < 0.01). The most significant fecal metabolite module (FDR-adjusted P = 0.008) was dominated by DHA and EPA. 3) A low-fiber, high-fat diet in the late second trimester is strongly associated with the development of SPTB. Conclusions: Reduced α-diversity of the gut microbiota and higher excretion of omega-3 (n–3) fatty acids in stool may provide a novel biomarker signature predicting SPTB in women with a low-fiber, high-fat diet. Further investigation of these markers in a larger sample is needed for validation"

However, the heterogeneity of fibroblast phenotypes, exacerbated by the lack of a common cross-tissue taxonomy, has limited the understanding of which pathways are shared by multiple diseases. To investigate, we profiled patient-derived fibroblasts from inflamed and non-inflamed synovium, intestine, lung, and salivary glands with single-cell RNA-sequencing. We integrated all fibroblasts into a multi-tissue atlas to characterize shared and tissue-specific phenotypes. Two shared clusters, CXCL10+CCL19+ immune-interacting and SPARC+COL3A1+ vascular-interacting fibroblasts were expanded in all inflamed tissues and additionally mapped to dermal analogues in a public atopic dermatitis atlas. We further confirmed these human pro-inflammatory fibroblasts in animal models of lung, joint, and intestinal inflammation.

Few studies have compared replication dynamics and host responses to SARS-CoV-2 in cell lines from different tissues and species. Therefore, we investigated the role of tissue type and antiviral genes during SARS-CoV-2 infection in nonhuman primate (kidney) and human (liver, respiratory epithelial, gastric) cell lines. We report different viral growth kinetics and release among the cell lines despite comparable ACE2 expression. Transcriptomics revealed that absence of STAT1 in nonhuman primate cells appeared to enhance inflammatory responses without effecting infectious viral titer. Deletion of RL-6 in respiratory epithelial cells increased viral replication. Impaired infectious virus release was detected in Huh7 but not Huh7.5 cells, suggesting a role for RIG1. Gastric cells MKN45 exhibited robust antiviral gene expression and supported viral replication.

Evaluation of 30 analyzable children with AD and 30 analyzable nonatopic controls is planned. Subjects immunized with varicella vaccine will have blood drawn for laboratory evaluations 3 weeks after immunization. The immune response to varicella will be assessed by measuring the proportion of varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-specific T cells, perforin production, and VZV-specific antibody titers. Because of the and systemic T helper cell 2 (Th2) polarization of subjects with AD, an altered response to varicella vaccination expected.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, either de novo or a reactivation infection, is recognized to result in detrimental alloimmune effects, inclusive of higher susceptibility to graft rejection and opportunistic infections and a substantive impact on chronic graft injury and reduced transplant survival. We studied perturbations in the circulating host proteome serially, before and after transplantation, and during and after CMV DNA replication (DNAemia), as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR), to obtain further insights into the evolution and pathogenesis of CMV infection in an immunocompromised host. Method. LC-MS-based proteomics was conducted on 168 serially banked plasma samples, at protocol times of 3- and 12-months post-transplant, before and 1 week and 1 month after detection of CMV DNAemia. Sixty-two propensity score-matched kidney transplant recipients were enrolled, stratified by CMV replication status into 31 with CMV DNAemia and 31 without CMV DNAemia. Plasma proteins were analyzed using an LCMS 8060 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Differential expression analysis was conducted using R and Limma. An integrative analysis with transcriptome data on matching PBMCs was also carried out. Result. Samples were segregated based on their proteomic profiles with respect to their CMV Dnaemia status. A subset of 17 plasma proteins was observed to predict the onset of CMV at 3 months post-transplant enriching platelet degranulation (FDR, 4.83E-06), acute inflammatory response (FDR, 0.0018), blood coagulation (FDR, 0.0018) pathways. Analysis of plasma proteome comparing patients with and without DNAemia revealed an increase in the immune complex proteins and immune-related protein as a response to CMV infection. Compared to pre-DNAemia plasma proteome, post-DNAemia timepoint plasma proteome revealed increased protein levels of proteins such as anti-inflammatory adipokine vaspin (SERPINA12), copper binding protein ceruloplasmin (CP), complement activating protein CFH enriching immune processes such as complement activation (FDR=0.03), Humoral immune response (FDR=0.01), innate immune response (FDR=0.01). Conclusion. High throughput plasma proteomics revealed proteomic perturbation impacting immune system-associated pathways during CMV infection and provided insights into biomarkers for CMV disease prediction and resolution. Further studies to understand the clinical impact of these pathways in formulating different types and duration of anti-viral therapies in the immunocompromised host."

Using mass cytometry to obtain single-cell resolution, we identified 31 cell populations at the MFI, including 25 immune cell types and six non-immune cell types. Among the immune cells, maternal PD1+ CD8 T cells subsets were less abundant in term laboring compared to term non-laboring. Among the non-immune cells, PD-L1+ maternal (stromal) and fetal (extravillous trophoblast) cells were more abundant in term laboring compared to preterm laboring pregnancies. Consistent with these observations, the expression of CD274, the gene encoding PD-L1, was significantly depressed and less responsive to fetal signaling molecules in cultured mesenchymal stromal cells from the decidua of preterm compared to term pregnancies. Overall, these results suggest that the PD1/PD-L1 pathway at the MFI may perturb the delicate balance between immune tolerance and rejection and contribute to the onset of spontaneous preterm labor."

The mechanisms of action modulating the plasticity between Th17 and Treg cells are incompletely understood. To gain a better understanding of the differentiation process we have constructed a computational model in COPASI that mimics CD4+ T cell differentiation and contemplates the plasticity between effector Th17 and Treg. Our computer simulations predicted that activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARg) induces a switch from already differentiated Th17 into Treg. Experimental validation approaches support this in silico prediction. The conclusion of this project is that PPARg promotes differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into Treg, downregulates Th17 differentiation and favors phenotype switch from Th17 into Treg cells."

445,2014,,,,SDY217,,,Orchestration of CD4 T cell epitope preferences after multi-peptide immunization,"A detailed understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie epitope preferences in T cell priming is important for vaccines designed to elicit a broad T cell response. Protein vaccinations generally elicit CD4 T cell responses that are skewed toward a small fraction of epitopes, a phenomenon known as immunodominance. This characteristic of T cell responses, that limits the diversity of CD4 T cell recognition, is generally attributed to intracellular antigen processing. However, we recently discovered that immunodominance hierarchies persist even after vaccination with synthetic peptides. In this study, we probed the regulatory mechanisms that cause diminished CD4 T cell responses to subdominant peptides after such multi-peptide immunization in mice. We have found that the delivery of subdominant and dominant epitopes on separate dendritic cells rescues expansion of less favored CD4 T cells. Furthermore, through the use of genetic models and inhibitors, we have found that selective losses in CD4 T cell responses are mediated by an IFN-gamma-induced pathway, involving indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and that regulatory T cell (Treg) activities may also regulate preferences in CD4 T cell specificity. We propose that after multi-peptide immunization, the expansion and differentiation of dominant T cells initiate complex regulatory events that determine the final peptide specificity of the elicited CD4 T cell response."

The model had high accuracy in early pregnancy using urine metabolome and plasma proteome. A model using only nine urine metabolites had the highest accuracy and was validated on an independent cohort. Univariate analysis further confirmed statistical significance of all metabolites and proteins chosen by the prediction models. Longitudinal modeling revealed biological pathways associated with preeclampsia and confirmed known pathological alterations while suggesting novel associations between the immune and proteomic dynamics. The study identified several biological pathways associated with preeclampsia including steroid hormone biosynthesis (both early in pregnancy and over gestation), tryptophan and caffeine metabolisms (over gestation) and arachidonic acid metabolism (in early pregnancy). Integration with clinical variables further improved prediction accuracy of the urine metabolome model. The findings could lead to a simple, early diagnostic test for preeclampsia."

461,7037,,,,SDY2209,,,CD8 Depletion,"Cell-mediated immunity is critical for control of M. tuberculosis infection. Although the importance of CD4 T cells in control of tuberculosis is well-established, the importance of CD8+ lymphocytes is less clear. Here, we investigated the requirement for all CD8+ lymphocytes (innate and adaptive) or just CD8 alpha/beta adaptive T cells in control of initial and early infection in cynomolgus macaques, using anti-CD8alpha or anti-CD8beta depleting antibodies in vivo. Flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of lung granulomas from control (undepleted) macaques at 6 weeks post-infection revealed a rich landscape of cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes. Anti-CD8alpha antibody resulted in susbstantial loss of all CD8+ lymphocytes from granulomas, while anti-CD8beta antibody selectively depleted classical CD8alpha beta T cells. In CD8-depleted granulomas, CD4 T cells and gamma delta T cells had increased expression of certain cytotoxic effectors, such as granzymes. However, these cells had reduced expression of perforin, granulysin, and/or CCL5, and thus displayed an incomplete cytotoxic profile. At 6 weeks post-infection, CD8 alpha depleted macaques had increased granuloma numbers, lung inflammation, and total thoracic bacterial burden, while CD8beta-depleted macaques showed increased lymph node bacterial burden. Mtb barcode analysis revealed that depletion of all CD8+ lymphocytes resulted in greater initial establishment of Mtb in the lungs, indicating a loosening of the airway bottleneck for infection, and increased dissemination of Mtb within lungs, to lymph nodes and to extrapulmonary sites. These data suggest that the total CD8+ lymphocyte population is critical for early control of Mtb infection in macaques and support the importance of targeting CD8+ lymphocytes in a vaccine strategy."

463,7155,,,,SDY2213,,,Drivers of Heterogeneity in Synovial Fibroblasts in Rheumatoid Arthritis.,"Inflammation of non-barrier immunologically quiescent tissues is associated with a massive influx of blood-borne innate and adaptive immune cells. Cues from the latter are likely to alter and expand activated states of the resident cells. However, local communications between immigrant and resident cell types in human inflammatory disease remain poorly understood. Here, we explored drivers of fibroblasts-like synoviocytes (FLS) heterogeneity in inflamed joints of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients using paired single cell RNA and ATAC sequencing (scRNA/ATAC-seq), multiplexed imaging, and spatial transcriptomics along with in vitro modeling of cell extrinsic factor signaling. These analyses suggest that local exposures to myeloid and T cell derived cytokines, TNF, IFN, IL-1, or lack thereof, drive four distinct FLS states some of which closely resemble fibroblast states in other disease-affected tissues including skin and colon. Our results highlight a role for concurrent, spatially distributed cytokine signaling within the inflamed synovium."
464,7156,,,,SDY2216,,,Waning and boosting of antibody Fc-effector functions upon SARS-CoV-2 vaccination,"Here we deeply profiled the functional humoral immune response induced by CoronaVac and Pfizer/BNT162b2 vaccines. Particularly we analyzed how the vaccine-induced functional responses waned with time and characterized the boosting capacity of the BNT162b2 vaccine, which enhanced the overall humoral responses of CoronaVac primed vaccinees to levels that were higher than the peak responses seen in the recipients vaccinated with two doses of the CoronaVac or BNT162b2 vaccines. We identified that Fc-receptor binding antibodies waned much faster than binding IgG1. Moreover, while antibody functions were induced against Omicron following BNT162b2 vaccination, these responses waned rapidly over time and were not observed in the setting of CoronaVac vaccination. Importantly, mRNA boosting of the CoronaVac response yielded a striking enhancement of functional humoral immunity across VOCs, including Omicron. These data collectively point to marked vaccine platform-based differences in peak functional humoral protection, as well as their distinct waning profiles. This phenotype can be enhanced and, in several cases, functionally expanded by heterologous boosting. "

To determine whether D614G might also mediate neutralization escape that could compromise vaccine efficacy, sera from spike-immunized mice, nonhuman primates, and humans were evaluated for neutralization of pseudoviruses bearing either D614 or G614 spike. In all cases, the G614 pseudovirus was moderately more susceptible to neutralization. The G614 pseudovirus also was more susceptible to neutralization by receptor-binding domain (RBD) monoclonal antibodies and convalescent sera from people infected with either form of the virus. Negative stain electron microscopy revealed a higher percentage of the 1-RBD """"up"""" conformation in the G614 spike, suggesting increased epitope exposure as a mechanism of enhanced vulnerability to neutralization. Based on these findings, the D614G mutation is not expected to be an obstacle for current vaccine development."

489,7033,,,,SDY2246,,,Convalescent plasma anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomain and receptor-binding domain IgG correlate with virus neutralization,"The newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) highlights the urgent need for assays that detect protective levels of neutralizing antibodies. We studied the relationship among anti-spike ectodomain (anti-ECD), anti-receptor-binding domain (anti-RBD) IgG titers, and SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization (VN) titers generated by 2 in vitro assays using convalescent plasma samples from 68 patients with COVID-19. We report a strong positive correlation between both plasma anti-RBD and anti-ECD IgG titers and in vitro VN titers. The probability of a VN titer of greater than or equal to 160, the FDA-recommended level for convalescent plasma used for COVID-19 treatment, was greater than or equal to 80 percent when anti-RBD or anti-ECD titers were greater than or equal to 1:1350. Of all donors, 37 percent lacked VN titers of greater than or equal to 160. Dyspnea, hospitalization, and disease severity were significantly associated with higher VN titer. Frequent donation of convalescent plasma did not significantly decrease VN or IgG titers. Analysis of 2814 asymptomatic adults found 73 individuals with anti-ECD IgG titers of greater than or equal to 1:50 and strong positive correlation with anti-RBD and VN titers. Fourteen of these individuals had VN titers of greater than or equal to 1:160, and all of them had anti-RBD titers of greater than or equal to 1:1350. We conclude that anti-RBD or anti-ECD IgG titers can serve as a surrogate for VN titers to identify suitable plasma donors. Plasma anti-RBD or anti-ECD titers of greater than or equal to 1:1350 may provide critical information about protection against COVID-19 disease."

504,2014,,,,SDY226,,,Heterosubtypic Influenza infection antagonizes elicitation of immunological reactivity to hemagglutinin,"Influenza-specific immunity in humans is unique because there are repeated exposures to viral strains containing genetically conserved epitopes recruiting memory CD4 T cells and novel epitopes stimulating naive CD4 T cells, possibly resulting in competition between memory and naive lymphocytes. In this study, we evaluated the effect of this competition on CD4 T cell and B cell response specificity using a murine model of sequential influenza infection. We found striking and selective decreases in CD4 T cell reactivity to nonconserved hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes following secondary influenza infection. Surprisingly, this shift in CD4 T cell specificity was associated with dramatic decreases in HA-specific Ab. These results suggest that repeated exposure to influenza viruses and vaccines containing conserved internal proteins may have unintended and negative consequences on the ability to induce HA-specific Ab to novel pandemic strains of influenza. These finding could have important implications on pandemic influenza preparedness strategies."

515,7037,,,,SDY2277,,,Specific CD4+ T cell phenotypes associate with bacterial control in people who ‘resist’ infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"A subset of individuals with a high probability of exposure to M. tuberculosis (M.tb) appears to ‘resist’ established M.tb infection, as demonstrated by serially negative tuberculin skin test (TST) or IFN-γ release assay (IGRA) results. While these ‘resisters’ (RSTR) display IFN-γ-independent T cell responses to the M.tb-specific antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10, it is currently unknown whether unique T cell functional programs are associated with this clinical outcome. We used multi-modal single-cell RNA, TCR sequencing, multi-parameter flow cytometry, and cytokine analysis in a discovery and validation format to compare the phenotypes and functions of M.tb-specific T cells between RSTRs and matched controls with ‘latent’ M.tb infection (LTBI). M.tb-specific T cells were clonally expanded in both RSTRs and LTBIs, confirming the priming of adaptive immune responses after M.tb exposure. However, M.tb-specific T cells derived from RSTRs showed enrichment of T regulatory as well as Th17-like functional programs compared to LTBIs, which were characterized by Th1*-like effector programs. Th17-like functional programs were also associated with a lack of progression to active TB among South African adolescents with LTBI, as well as bacterial control in published non-human primate studies. Together, these data suggest that ‘resisters’ may successfully control M.tb after exposure and immune priming and establish a set of T cell biomarkers to facilitate further study of this important clinical phenotype."
516,7185,,,,SDY2279,,,CD8+ T cells protect against CVB3 infection in females.,"Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is the primary cause of viral myocarditis, and approximately 5% of symptomatic CVB3 infections are fatal. CVB3 infection also exhibits a strong sex bias, with males showing increased susceptibility to disease, which is incompletely understood. Despite these burdens, there are no vaccines or treatments available for Coxsackievirus infections. Using an oral inoculation mouse model to recapitulate natural infection, we demonstrated a sex bias where male mice succumb to CVB3-induced disease at an increased rate than female mice, consistent with human infections. Here we make the novel observation that CVB3 induces the expansion of antigen-experienced CD8+ T cells in female mice but not in male mice. The CD8+ T cells in female mice have an activated phenotype following infection, and we demonstrate that these T cells protect female mice from CVB3-induced mortality. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of evaluating sex differences in the immune response to viral pathogens and may have implications for future T cell vaccine strategies."

Use of lung donors from NDRI to make organoids, then lung organoid-derived air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures with infection of SARS-CoV2 like virus or mock. To better understand the early spatiotemporal events happening in lung epithelium during SARS-CoV-2 infection and their potential biological consequences, we based our study on an in vitro model of primary human airway epithelial cells: air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures generated from human lung organoids from healthy donors. Such cultures effectively recapitulate in vivo airway epithelium architecture and we validated their permissibility to viral infection by exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-like, USA/WA1-2020) and its variants (Beta, Delta and Omicron BA.1 subvariant). Our findings reveal spatiotemporal regulation of cytokines, chemokines and suggest that different cells in the lung epithelium may regulate different aspects of immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the use of lung organoid-derived ALI from a variety of donors revealed differential infection dynamics reflecting biological differences between individuals, potentially explaining some of the diverse clinical outcomes observed between patients."

Because their activation is controlled by a variety of combinatorially expressed activating and inhibitory receptors, NK cell diversity and function are closely linked. To provide an unprecedented understanding of NK cell repertoire diversity, we used mass cytometry to simultaneously analyze 35 parameters, including 28 NK cell receptors, on peripheral blood NK cells from five sets of monozygotic twins and twelve unrelated donors of defined HLA and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genotype. This analysis revealed a remarkable degree of NK cell diversity, with an estimated 6,000-30,000 phenotypic populations within an individual and >100,000 phenotypes in this population. Genetics largely determined inhibitory receptor expression, whereas activation receptor expression was heavily environmentally influenced. Therefore, NK cells may maintain self-tolerance through strictly regulated expression of inhibitory receptors, while using adaptable expression patterns of activating and costimulatory receptors to respond to pathogens and tumors. These findings further suggest the possibility that discrete NK cell subpopulations could be harnessed for immunotherapeutic strategies in the settings of infection, reproduction, and transplantation"

574,6696,,,,SDY2365,,,Interactions between Siglec-8 and endogenous sialylated cis ligands restrain cell death induction in human eosinophils and mast cells,"Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec)-8 is a sialoside-binding receptor expressed on the surface of eosinophils and mast cells that bears an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and an ITIM-like motif in its cytoplasmic domain. On eosinophils that have been primed with IL-5, GM-CSF, or IL-33, antibody ligation of Siglec-8 leads to cell death through a pathway involving the β2 integrin-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via NADPH oxidase. In contrast, engagement of Siglec-8 on mast cells has been described to inhibit mast cell activation and mediator release but not impact cell viability. The differences in responses between cytokine-primed and unprimed eosinophils, and between eosinophils and mast cells, to Siglec-8 ligation are not understood. In addition, we have previously found that Siglec-8 binds to sialylated ligands on the surface of the same cell (so-called cis ligands) on eosinophils, preventing interaction with a Siglec-8 ligand in trans. However, the functional relevance of these cis ligands have not been elucidated. We therefore explored the potential influence of cis ligands of Siglec-8 on the surfaces of both eosinophils and mast cells. Removal of sialic acid using exogenous sialidase had profound effects on the consequences of Siglec-8 antibody engagement on both cell types, eliminating the need for cytokine priming of eosinophils to facilitate cell death and enabling Siglec-8-dependent mast cell death without impacting anti-Siglec-8 antibody binding. The cell death process licensed by incubation with sialidase resembled that characterized in IL-5-primed eosinophils, including the upregulation of CD11b, production of ROS, and requirement for the signaling activities of Syk, PI3K, and PLC. These results implicate cis ligands in restraining Siglec-8 function on eosinophils and mast cells and reveal a promising approach to the selective depletion of mast cells in patients with mast cell-mediated diseases."

To further understand the protective effect on the baby, we also evaluated transplacental antibody transfer by profiling maternal and umbilical cord blood in 175 maternal-neonatal dyads. These analyses reveal vaccine-dependent and trimester-dependent antibody response in the mother and fetus, with higher titers and functions by mRNA vaccines, and an increased maternal immune response from the first and third trimester of vaccination. These results provide novel insight into the impact of platform and trimester of vaccination on maternal humoral immune response and transplacental antibody transfer."

In order to facilitate the development of such vaccines, understanding how viral proteins can contribute to protection from disease is critical. Much of the previous work to address these questions relied on reductionist systems (i.e., vaccination with individual proteins or virus- like particles [VLPs] that contain only a few viral proteins); thus, we have an incomplete understanding of how immunity to different subsets of viral proteins contributes to protection. Here, we report the development of a platform in which a single viral protein can be deleted from an authentic viral particle that retains the remaining full complement of structural proteins and viral RNA. As a first study with this system, we chose to delete the major influenza A virus (IAV) antigen, the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, to evaluate how the other components of the viral particle contribute en masse to protection from influenza disease. Our results show that while anti-HA immunity plays a major role in protection from challenge with a vaccine-matched strain, the contributions from other structural proteins were the major drivers of protection against highly antigenically drifted, homosubtypic strains. This work highlights the importance of evaluating the inclusion of non-HA viral proteins in the development of broadly efficacious and long-lasting influenza vaccines."

697,7284,,,,SDY2534,,,Human TFH responses to malaria specific antigen using a Kenyan cross sectional study,"The goal of this study was to highlight the profile of the circulating T follicular helper (TFH) cells in children and adults living in high Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) transmission area and the responses of these specific T cells to in vitro stimulation by two Pf malaria specific antigens PfSEA-1A and PfGARP which are also investigated as vaccine candidates. Having a better understanding on how TFH cells reacts to vaccine candidates can help in down-selecting them. For this study, we used spectral flow cytometry and unbiased clustering analysis to identify the different type of TFH cells as well as assessing their specific cytokines and transcription factors profile responses to the two vaccine candidates PfSEA-1A and PfGARP. WE also used multiplex-bead based immunoassay to assess the Pf malaria serology of each participants. We found that in children, all the types of cTFH produced cytokines and transcription factors after stimulation whereas the specific response was mainly focus on the cTFH17 and cTFH1/17 in adults. Knowing that cTFH17 are associated with the maintenance of antibody memory responses, these results suggest that PfSEA-1A and PfGARP might trigger a better antibody response in adults compared to children. Moreover, we found that PfGARP induced significantly more of Bcl6 within cTFH cells, Bcl6 being an essential transcription factor for the cTFH function of helping B cell development and antibody production suggesting that it might be a better candidates than PfSEA-1A."

699,7037,,,,SDY2540,,,Multi-modal data integration using Markov Field graphical networks predicts B cell depletion and immune responses associated with protective intravenous BCG (IV-BCG) vaccination against tuberculosis in macaques,"Multi-modal datasets provide rich information that can help identify critical multi-scale interactions underlying biological systems. However, identifying associations between features and outputs can be beset by spurious connections due to indirect impacts propagating through an unmapped biological network. We applied a probabilistic graphical modeling approach, Markov Fields, to dissect correlations between immune features in a public multi-modal dataset (systems serology, cytokines, cytometry) of macaques undergoing intravenous BCG vaccination against tuberculosis. This yielded an interaction network that interprets network paths underlying vaccine efficacy, and shows how correlations between features often arise indirectly. We next conducted experimental depletion of B cells during vaccination in macaques—which did not reduce protection against tuberculosis—to validate our Markov Field model’s predictions of network-wide shifts post-depletion. Finally, we highlight immune changes predicted to strongly affect intravenous BCG vaccine efficacy, showing that probabilistic graphical models increase the interpretability of multi-modal datasets for identifying new disease targets."
700,7037,,,,SDY2541,,,FC-Engineering-EI,"ABSTRACT Novel vaccination and therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the tuberculosis (TB) epidemic. While extensive efforts have focused on potentiating cell-mediated immunity to control Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, less effort has been invested in exploiting the humoral immune system to combat Mtb. Emerging data point to a role for antibodies in microbial control of Mtb, however the precise mechanism(s) of this control remain incompletely understood. Here we took an antibody Fc-engineering approach to determine whether Fc-modifications could improve the ability of antibodies to restrict Mtb, and to define Fc-mediated mechanism(s) antibodies leverage for this restriction. Using an antibody specific to the capsular polysaccharide α-glucan, we engineered a panel of Fc variants to augment or dampen select antibody effector functions, rationally building antibodies with enhanced capacity to promote Mtb restriction in a human whole blood model of infection. Surprisingly, several restrictive Fc-engineered antibodies drove Mtb control in a neutrophil, not monocyte, dependent manner. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we show that an Fc-engineered antibody with restrictive activity promotes neutrophil survival and expression of cell intrinsic antimicrobial programs. These data provide a roadmap for exploiting Fc-engineered antibodies as a novel class of TB therapeutics able to harness the protective functions of neutrophils to achieve disease control."

733,7033,,,,SDY2581,,,Host Predictors of Broadly Cross-Reactive Antibodies Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Variants of Concern Differ Between Infection and Vaccination,"Following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or vaccination there is significant variability between individuals in protective antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2, and within individuals against different virus variants. However, host demographic or clinical characteristics that predict variability in cross-reactive antibody levels are not well-described. These data could inform clinicians, researchers, and policymakers on the populations most likely to require vaccine booster in an institutional review board approved prospective observational cohort study of staff at St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital, we identified participants with plasma samples collected after SARS-CoV-2 infection, after mRNA vaccination, and after vaccination following infection, and quantitated immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) from 5 important SARS-CoV-2 variants (Wuhan Hu-1, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.617.2). We used regression models to identify factors that contributed to cross-reactive IgG against 1 or multiple viral variants. Following infection, a minority of the cohort generated cross-reactive antibodies, IgG antibodies that bound all tested variants. Those who did had increased disease severity, poor metabolic health, and were of a particular ancestry. Vaccination increased the levels of cross-reactive IgG levels in all populations, including immunocompromised, elderly, and persons with poor metabolic health. Younger people with a healthy weight mounted the highest responses.Our findings provide important new information on individual antibody responses to infection/vaccination that could inform clinicians on populations that may require follow-on immunization."

To gain insight into how vaccines induce protection of the most vulnerable, our project employs two novel approaches studying newborn responses to hepatitis B vaccine (HBV): (a) systems biology that uses technologies which comprehensively measure global changes in molecules such as transcriptomics (RNA) and proteomics (proteins), as well as cell composition of the blood and (b) use of human newborn blood components, collected prior to immunization, to model vaccine responses in vitro (outside the body). Characterizing vaccine-induced molecular patterns (signatures) that correspond to vaccine-mediated protection will accelerate development and optimization of vaccines against early life infections of major global health importance."
737,6569,,,,SDY2586,,,Mouse Blood Gene signature,"In the search for biological markers after a large-scale exposure of the human population to radiation, gene expression is a sensitive endpoint easily translatable to in-field high throughput applications. Primarily, the ex-vivo irradiated healthy human blood model has been used to generate available gene expression datasets. This model has limitations i.e., lack of signaling from other irradiated tissues and deterioration of blood cells cultures over time. In vivo models are needed; therefore, we present our novel approach to define a gene signature in mouse blood cells that quantitatively correlates with radiation dose (at 1 Gy/min). Starting with available microarray datasets, we selected 30 radiation-responsive genes and performed cross-validation/training-testing data splits to downselect 16 radiation-responsive genes. We then tested these genes in an independent cohort of irradiated adult C57BL/6 mice (50:50 both sexes) and measured mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR in whole blood at 24 h. Dose reconstruction using net signal (difference between geometric means of top 3 positively correlated and top 4 negatively correlated genes with dose), was highly improved over the microarrays, with a root mean square error of +/-1.1 Gy in male and female mice combined. There were no significant sex-specific differences in mRNA or cell counts after irradiation."

742,7282,,,,SDY2594,,,A phase II randomized trial with autologous polyclonal expanded regulatory T cells in children with new onset type 1 diabetes,"CD4+CD25hiCD127lo/-FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a key role in preventing autoimmunity. In autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D), adoptive transfer of autologous polyclonal Tregs has been shown to be safe in adults in Phase I clinical trials. We explored factors contributing to efficacy of autologous polyclonal expanded Tregs (expTregs) in a randomized Phase II multi-center, double-blind, clinical trial in 110 treated children and adolescents with new-onset T1D (Sanford/Lisata Therapeutics T-Rex Phase II trial) randomized 1:1:1 to high- (24*10^6 cells/kg) or low- (1*10^6 cells/kg) dose treatments or to matching placebo. Cytometry, bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing were performed on selected expTregs and peripheral blood samples from participants. The single doses of expTregs were safe but did not prevent the decline in residual beta cell function over one year compared to placebo (P = 0.94 low dose, P = 0.21 high dose), regardless of age or baseline C-peptide. ExpTregs were highly activated and suppressive in vitro. A transient increase of activated memory Tregs was detectable one week after infusion in the high dose cohort suggesting effective transfer of expTregs. However, in vitro fold expansion of expTregs varied across participants even when accounting for age and lower fold expansion and its associated gene signature were linked with better C-peptide preservation regardless of Treg dose. These results suggest that a single dose of polyclonal expTregs does not alter progression in T1D; instead, Treg quality may be an important factor."

However, the effects of repeated exposures to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigens on memory T cells are poorly understood. Here, we utilize major histocompatibility complex multimers with single-cell RNA sequencing to profile SARS-CoV-2-responsive T cells ex vivo from humans with one, two or three antigen exposures, including vaccination, primary infection and breakthrough infection. Exposure order determined the distribution between spike-specific and non-spike-specific responses, with vaccination after infection leading to expansion of spike-specific T cells and differentiation to CCR7 CD45RA+effectors. In contrast, individuals after breakthrough infection mount vigorous non-spike-specific responses. Analysis of over 4,000 epitope-specific T cell antigen receptor (TCR) sequences demonstrates that all exposures elicit diverse repertoires characterized by shared TCR motifs, confirmed by monoclonal TCR characterization, with no evidence for repertoire narrowing from repeated exposure. Our findings suggest that breakthrough infections diversify the T cell memory repertoire and current vaccination protocols continue to expand and differentiate spike-specific memory."

799,7033,,,,SDY2660,,,Pre-existing humoral immunity to human common cold coronaviruses negatively impacts the protective SARS-CoV-2 antibody response,"SARS-CoV-2 infection causes diverse outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to respiratory distress and death. A major unresolved question is whether prior immunity to endemic, human common cold coronaviruses (hCCCoVs) impacts susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or immunity following infection and vaccination. Therefore, we analyzed samples from the same individuals before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We found hCCCoV antibody levels increase after SARS-CoV-2 exposure, demonstrating cross-reactivity. However, a case-control study indicates that baseline hCCCoV antibody levels are not associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rather, higher magnitudes of pre-existing betacoronavirus antibodies correlate with more SARS-CoV-2 antibodies following infection, an indicator of greater disease severity. Additionally, immunization with hCCCoV spike proteins before SARS-CoV-2 immunization impedes the generation of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in mice. Together, these data suggest that pre-existing hCCCoV antibodies hinder SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based immunity following infection and provide insight on how pre-existing coronavirus immunity impacts SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is critical considering emerging variants."

The CamkIV gene is involved in several processes of the immune system, such as T cell development,inflammatory response and hematopoietic stem cell maintenance. However, nothing is known about the possible role of CaMKIV in B cell responses.

However, the changes that occur in the lung cellular milieu post-primary Mtb infection and their contributions to protection upon reinfection remain poorly understood. Here, using clinical and microbiological endpoints in a non-human primate reinfection model, we demonstrate that prior Mtb infection elicits a long-lasting protective response against subsequent Mtb exposure and that the depletion of CD4-positive T cells prior to Mtb rechallenge significantly abrogates this protection. Leveraging microbiologic, PET-CT, flow cytometric, and single-cell RNA-seq data from primary infection, reinfection, and reinfection-CD4-positive T cell depleted granulomas, we identify differential cellular and microbial features of control. The data collectively demonstrate that the presence of CD4-positive T cells in the setting of reinfection results in a reduced inflammatory lung milieu characterized by reprogrammed CD8-positive T cell activity, reduced neutrophilia, and blunted type-1 immune signaling among myeloid cells, mitigating Mtb disease severity. These results open avenues for developing vaccines and therapeutics that not only target CD4-positive and CD8-positive T cells, but also modulate innate immune cells to limit Mtb disease."

Postimmunization boosting has been shown to be beneficial for disease protection, and as new variants continue to emerge, periodic (and perhaps annual) vaccination will likely be recommended. New seasonal influenza virus vaccines currently need to be developed every year due to continual antigenic drift, an undertaking made possible by a robust global vaccine production and distribution infrastructure. To create a seasonal combination vaccine targeting both influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 that is also amenable to frequent reformulation, we have developed an influenza A virus (IAV) genetic platform that allows the incorporation of an immunogenic domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein onto IAV particles. Vaccination with this combination vaccine elicited neutralizing antibodies and provided protection from lethal challenge with both pathogens in mice. This approach may allow the leveraging of established influenza vaccine infrastructure to generate a cost-effective and scalable seasonal vaccine solution for both influenza and coronaviruses."

Study Design: This was a retrospective, single-center cohort study that included data and convenience samples from week-of-life (WoL) 3 from two independent preterm infant cohorts. Using previously banked samples, we applied our sample-sparing, high-throughput proteomics technology to compare OS and TA proteomes in infants born <32 weeks admitted to the Neonatology Intensive Care Unit (NICU) (Cohort 1; N=23 infants). In a separate similar cohort, we mapped the BPD-associated changes in the OS proteome (Cohort 2; N=17 infants including 8 with BPD). Results: In samples collected during the first month of life, we identified 607 proteins unique to OS, 327 proteins unique to TA, and 687 overlapping proteins belonging to pathways involved in immune effector processes, neutrophil degranulation, leukocyte mediated immunity, and metabolic processes. Furthermore, we identified 37 OS proteins that showed significantly differential abundance between BPD cases and controls: 13 were associated with metabolic and immune dysregulation, 10 of which (e.g., SERPINC1, CSTA, BPI) have been linked to BPD or other prematurity-related lung disease based on blood or TA investigations, but not OS. Conclusion: OS is a noninvasive, easily accessible alternative to TA, that is amenable to high-throughput proteomic analysis in preterm newborns. Additionally, OS samples can yield actionable biomarkers of BPD development and allow for timely, individualized treatment of at-risk infants."

917,7037,,,,SDY2820,,,Comparable Non-canonical T cell responses are associated with protection from tuberculosis in mice and humans,"While control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is generally understood to require a Th1-immune response and IFN secretion, infection produces a spectrum of immunological and pathological phenotypes in diverse human populations. By characterizing Mtb infection in a collection of mouse strains that models the genetic heterogeneity of an outbred population, we identified a subset of strains that control Mtb burden comparably to a standard IFN-dependent mouse model but with substantially lower lung IFN levels. Here we report that these mice have significantly fewer Th1 and more Th17 and regulatory T cells and that this phenotype is detectable before infection, indicating a general alteration in immune tone. The CD4 T cells are less activated, have a lower polyfunctionality score, and are specifically lacking the terminal effector Th1 subset. These mice still require T cells to control bacterial burden but are less dependent on IFN signaling for this function. Instead, non-canonical immune features such as CD4 Th17 and T cells correlate with low bacterial burden. We find that the same Th17 transcriptional programs in CD4 T cells are associated with resistance to Mtb infection in humans, implicating specific non-Th1 T cell responses as a common feature of Mtb control across species."

931,3670,,,,SDY2842,,,Site-specific development and progressive maturation of human tissue-resident memory T cells over infancy and childhood,"Infancy and childhood are critical life stages for generating immune memory to protect against pathogens; however, the timing, location, and pathways for memory development in humans remain elusive. Here, we investigated T cells in mucosal sites, lymphoid tissues, and blood from 96 pediatric donors aged 0-10 years using phenotypic, functional, and transcriptomic profiling. Our results revealed that memory T cells preferentially localized in the intestines and lungs during infancy and accumulated more rapidly in mucosal sites compared with blood and lymphoid organs, consistent with site-specific antigen exposure. Early life mucosal memory T cells exhibit distinct functional capacities and stem-like transcriptional profiles. In later childhood, they progressively adopt proinflammatory functions and tissue-resident signatures, coincident with increased T cell receptor (TCR) clonal expansion in mucosal and lymphoid sites. Together, our findings identify staged development of memory T cells targeted to tissues during the formative years, informing how we might promote and monitor immunity in children."

B cell depleting (BCD) therapies used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS), diminish this humoral response, though T cell-mediated immunity can be generated. To study the long-term persistence of these differential responses, the effects of different types and modes of immune modulators, and the resultant effects of protection in patients with MS, we evaluated the humoral and cellular response to COVID-19 vaccines in patients with MS from four centers, ranging from one to 70 weeks post-vaccination. BCD therapies in patients with MS significantly reduced the antibody response and enhanced the cellular response to COVID-19 vaccination, with some variations among different anti-CD20 drugs. Despite these alterations persisting for many months following vaccination, the patients retained protective immunity. These results highlight the critical role of T cell-mediated immunity in anti-viral protection independent of humoral immunity."

When compared to GFR estimates using predictive equations at each of these time points, we can evaluate the accuracy of estimated GFR in white and black donor populations."
975,7531,,,,SDY2914,,,Tumor-specific CD8+ Tc9 cells activate host CD4+ T cells to control antigen-lost tumors,"Host effector CD4+ T cells are emerging as an important contributor for tumor regression but whether they can be activated by adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells remains unknown. We reported that adoptive transfer of murine tumor-specific CD8+ Tc9 but not Tc1-CTL cells achieved long-term control of tumor growth in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that murine tumor-specific Tc9 cells not only kill antigen expressing primary tumors but also control the outgrowth of antigen-lost relapsed tumors by recruiting and activating host effector CD4+ T cells that recognize relapsed tumors. Tc9 cells secreted interleukin (IL) 24 and recruited CCR7-expressing conventional type-2 dendritic cells (cDC2) into tumor-draining lymph nodes to prime host CD4+ T cell response against relapsed tumors. Depleting host CD4+ T cells or deficiency in cDC2 impaired Tc9 cells ability to control the outgrowth of relapsed tumor. We also observed that intratumoral IL24 expression was positively correlated with gene signatures of cDC2 and effector CD4+ T cells in human cancers and expression of IL24, cDC2 and CD4+ T cell gene signatures were positively associated with patients overall survival. This study thus uncovers a novel mechanism underlying the activation of tumor-specific CD4+ T cells in vivo."

1004,7033,,,,SDY2963,,,A multivalent nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine against all known influenza virus subtypes,"Seasonal influenza vaccines offer little protection against pandemic influenza virus strains. It is difficult to create effective prepandemic vaccines because it is uncertain which influenza virus subtype will cause the next pandemic. In this work, we developed a nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA)-lipid nanoparticle vaccine encoding hemagglutinin antigens from all 20 known influenza A virus subtypes and influenza B virus lineages. This multivalent vaccine elicited high levels of cross-reactive and subtype-specific antibodies in mice and ferrets that reacted to all 20 encoded antigens. Vaccination protected mice and ferrets challenged with matched and mismatched viral strains, and this protection was at least partially dependent on antibodies. Our studies indicate that mRNA vaccines can provide protection against antigenically variable viruses by simultaneously inducing antibodies against multiple antigens."

Antibodies are implicated in Mtb control, but the mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. We assembled a library of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and screened for Mtb-restrictive activity in mice, identifying protective antibodies targeting diverse antigens. To dissect the mechanism of mAb-mediated Mtb restriction, we optimized a protective lipoarabinomannan-specific mAb generating Fc-variants. In vivo analysis of these Fc-variants revealed a role for Fc-effector function in Mtb restriction. Restrictive Fc-variants altered distribution of Mtb across innate immune cells. Single-cell transcriptomics highlighted distinctly activated pathways within innate immune cell subpopulations, highlighting early activation of neutrophils as a key signature of mAb-mediated Mtb restriction. Therefore, antibody-mediated restriction of Mtb is associated with reorganization of the tissue-level immune response to infection and depends on the collaboration of antibody Fab and Fc."

Expression of IL-21, which may be produced by a number of T cell subsets, has been reported to increase during H. pylori infection. To investigate the role of IL-21 in the gastric mucosa during H. pylori infection, we combined mathematical modeling of CD4+ T cell differentiation with in vivo studies to elucidate the impact of IL-21 on H. pylori infection. Our computational modeling efforts predict that IL-21 activates the production of IFN gamma and IL17, the expression of Tbet and RORgamma t, the phosphorylation of STAT3, and suggest a potential role of IL-21 in the modulation of IL-10. To elucidate the role IL-21 in vivo, we infected IL-21 deficient mice and wild-type littermates with H. pylori strain SS1, and assessed colonization, gastric inflammation, cellular infiltration, and cytokine profiles in the gastric tissue."

Here we assessed 899 genes in CD8+ T cells responding to murine melanoma and identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase STUB1 as a novel negative regulator of anti-tumor CD8+ T cell function. We demonstrated that Stub1 knockout CD8+ T cells effectively control tumor growth across multiple murine models. Mechanistically, STUB1 interacts with the adapter protein CHIC2 to regulate cytokine receptor expression in mouse and human CD8+ T cells. Among the regulated cytokine receptors, IL-27Ra is essential for tumor growth control mediated by Stub1 or Chic2 knockout CD8+ T cells. Together, these findings establish the STUB1-CHIC2 complex as a novel regulator of cytokine receptor expression in CD8+ T cells and provide rationale for inhibiting this pathway to enhance CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity."

1104,532,,,,SDY313,,,HLA Genetics in Pediatric Arthritis,"Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) (also known as Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA)) includes the commonest chronic autoimmune arthropathies of childhood. The MHC is involved with respect to risk, either susceptibility or protection in a subtype specific manner with strong gender bias and differences between ethnicities. Multiple MHC effects have been shown, especially in the commonest subtype, so called early onset pauciarticular JRA (Persistent Oligo in the JIA terminology) with three or more MHC regions believed to interact in generating susceptibility. An additional feature of the disease, unlike some other forms of autoimmunity, is the relative absence of common extended or ancestral haplotypes, especially those carrying HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR7 both of which are protective. The three regions include a class I region, or an area telomeric to it, and two class II regions those around HLA DR/DQ and HLA-DP. None of the regions involved are well defined nor were the specific genes involved identified. The alleles marking these regions (HLA-DR8, 11 and HLA-DPB1*0201) are atypical for autoimmunity. This is therefore an unusual MHC contribution to autoimmunity, the elucidation of which lends itself to high throughput technologies. The genetic features, although involving arthritis, are quite distinct from adult rheumatoid arthritis except for about 5% of older children. It is proposed to construct high throughput SNP maps in a family based study. Subtypes have different MHC profiles and in the rarest and most severe form of disease, systemic onset JRA, the MHC effect is rather minimal. In this form, preliminary data involving KIR gene haplotypes is available. Pursuing these KIR gene observations is proposed. The ability to leverage ongoing phenotyping and family based sample collection ensures a large and continuously growing pool of available DMAs for this project. Some of the patients will also have extensive gene expression studies allowing a comprehensive approach to the MHC and KIR genes in JRA and its subtypes."

Two medications in this study are currently used in children, but there is no information regarding which drug is safer or more effective.

1114,3709,,,,SDY355,,,An Evaluation of IV Gamma Globulin As a Method to Improve Kidney Transplant Survival in Patients With End-Stage Renal Disease Who Are Highly Sensitized to Transplant Antigens (IG02),This study is designed to test the clinical and laboratory observations that suggest IVIG given before and after kidney transplant to patients who are sensitized (highly sensitive) to certain transplant antigens could result in reduced sensitization and reduced rates of kidney rejection. Some ESRD patients are highly sensitive to certain transplant antigens (foreign substances that activate the immune system) and must wait for a long time before a well-matched kidney becomes available. Transplant rejection is more likely among highly sensitized patients than in patients who are not highly sensitized. There is no proven method to improve a highly-sensitized patient's chances of receiving and keeping a transplanted kidney.

Varivax is a vaccine against varicella zoster virus (VZV), the virus that causes chicken pox (varicella) and shingles (zoster). Healthy children are already receiving Varivax shots to protect them from chicken pox. Few children with kidney transplants have received Varivax because doctors have been concerned that Varivax might cause serious reactions in them. On the other hand, VZV infection can be a life-threatening disease in these children. For this reason, doctors want to learn whether Varivax might safely prevent VZV infections in children who have had kidney transplants."
1117,3709,,,,SDY358,,,SRL1 A Study to Compare Treatment With Sirolimus Versus Standard Treatment in Patients Who Have Received a Kidney Transplant,"The purpose of this study is to compare treatment with the new drug sirolimus (SRL) versus the standard treatment with cyclosporine (CsA) or tacrolimus in children who have received kidney transplants. SRL is a new medication that may prevent the body's immune system from rejecting organ transplants. After receiving a kidney transplant, the body recognizes the donated kidney as a foreign invader and triggers the immune system to attack the kidney. This can lead to rejection of the new kidney and a failed transplant. To help reduce the risk of kidney rejection, transplant patients are given immunosuppressant drugs, which reduce the body's normal immune response and allow the transplanted organ to function. CsA or tacrolimus are two drugs that are often given to transplant patients. However, these are powerful drugs, and it can cause serious side effects and put a patient at increased risk for infections. SRL is a new drug that has been shown to reduce a transplant patient's chance of rejecting a new kidney, without serious side effects. This study is necessary to test the safety and effectiveness of SRL in children."

1119,3365,,,,SDY363,,,Key Role of T cell Defects in Age-Related Vulnerability to West Nile Virus,"In a mouse model of age-related vulnerability to WNV, we demonstrate that death correlates with increased viral titers in the brain and that this loss of virus control with age was the result of defects in the CD4 and CD8 T cell response against WNV. Specific age-related defects in T cell responses against dominant WNV epitopes were detected at the level of cytokine and lytic granule production, each of which are essential for resistance against WNV, and in the ability to generate multifunctional anti-WNV effector T cells, which are believed to be critical for robust antiviral immunity. In contrast, at the peak of the response, old and adult T cells exhibited superimposable peptide sensitivity. Most importantly, although the adult CD4 or CD8 T cells readily protected immunodeficient mice upon adoptive transfer, old T cells of either subset were unable to provide WNV-specific protection. Consistent with a profound qualitative and quantitative defect in T cell immunity, old brains contained at least 12x fewer total effector CD8 T cells compared with adult mice at the peak of brain infection. These findings identify potential targets for immunomodulation and treatment to combat lethal WNV infection in the elderly"

1137,2799,,,,SDY416,,,Study to measure the immune response to the influenza vaccine in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis,"Interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-23 are heterodimeric cytokines, with a common p40 subunit and a unique chain (IL-12p35 and IL-23p19). The p40 subunit of both interleukins binds to the transmembrane IL-12 receptor-beta1 (IL-12R ) on the surface of T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Ustekinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody, anti-IL12p40, which binds to the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 with high affinity and specificity, inhibiting the activity of both interleukins. Ustekinumab has proven to be highly effective in the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis, with up to 76% of patients achieving a 75% reduction in their psoriasis area and severity index (PASI-75).1, It is routinely recommended that psoriasis patients treated with biologic therapies such as ustekinumab be vaccinated annually with the influenza vaccine. We can thus assess the importance of these cytokines in the immune response to vaccination by comparing the immune response to influenza vaccination of psoriasis patients treated with ustekinumab with that of patients who are not receiving this treatment. We will assess gene expression profiles and white blood cell subsets in the blood of psoriasis patients before vaccination and at multiple time-points after vaccination."

1211,3365,,,,SDY649,,,Two separate defects affecting true naive or virtual memory T cell precursors combine to reduce naive T cell responses with aging.,"Naive T cell responses are eroded with aging. We and others have recently shown that unimmunized old mice lose ? 70% of Ag-specific CD8 T cell precursors and that many of the remaining precursors acquire a virtual (central) memory (VM; CD44(hi)CD62L(hi)) phenotype. In this study, we demonstrate that unimmunized TCR transgenic (TCRTg) mice also undergo massive VM conversion with age, exhibiting rapid effector function upon both TCR and cytokine triggering. Age-related VM conversion in TCRTg mice directly depended on replacement of the original TCRTg specificity by endogenous TCR? rearrangements, indicating that TCR signals must be critical in VM conversion. Importantly, we found that VM conversion had adverse functional effects in both old wild-type and old TCRTg mice; that is, old VM, but not old true naive, T cells exhibited blunted TCR-mediated, but not IL-15-mediated, proliferation. This selective proliferative senescence correlated with increased apoptosis in old VM cells in response to peptide, but decreased apoptosis in response to homeostatic cytokines IL-7 and IL-15. Our results identify TCR as the key factor in differential maintenance and function of Ag-specific precursors in unimmunized mice with aging, and they demonstrate that two separate age-related defects--drastic reduction in true naive T cell precursors and impaired proliferative capacity of their VM cousins--combine to reduce naive T cell responses with aging."

Whereas these studies focused on memory development, the impact of low-dose Rapa on the primary immune response, particularly as it relates to functional effector immunity, is far less clear. In this study, we investigated the impact of acute Rapa treatment on immune effector cell function during the primary immune response to several acute infections. We found that functional CD8 T cell and macrophage responses to both viral and intracellular bacterial pathogens were depressed in mice in vivo and in humans to phorbol ester and calcium ionophore stimulation in vitro in the face of low-dose Rapa treatment. Mechanistically, the CD8 defect was linked to impaired glycolytic switch in stimulated naive cells and the reduced formation of short-lived effector cells. Therefore, more than one cell type required for a protective effector immune response is impaired by Rapa in both mice and humans, at the dose shown to improve immune memory and extend lifespan. This urges caution with regard to the relative therapeutic costs and benefits of Rapa treatment as means to improve immune memory."
1215,3365,,,,SDY654,,,Lifespan-extending caloric restriction or mTOR inhibition impair adaptive immunity of old mice by distinct mechanisms.,"Aging of the world population and a concomitant increase in age-related diseases and disabilities mandates the search for strategies to increase healthspan, the length of time an individual lives healthy and productively. Due to the age-related decline of the immune system, infectious diseases remain among the top 5-10 causes of mortality and morbidity in the elderly, and improving immune function during aging remains an important aspect of healthspan extension. Calorie restriction (CR) and more recently rapamycin (rapa) feeding have both been used to extend lifespan in mice. Preciously few studies have actually investigated the impact of each of these interventions upon in vivo immune defense against relevant microbial challenge in old organisms. We tested how rapa and CR each impacted the immune system in adult and old mice. We report that each intervention differentially altered T-cell development in the thymus, peripheral T-cell maintenance, T-cell function and host survival after West Nile virus infection, inducing distinct but deleterious consequences to the aging immune system. We conclude that neither rapa feeding nor CR, in the current form/administration regimen, may be optimal strategies for extending healthy immune function and, with it, lifespan."

1217,3365,,,,SDY656,,,Histone deacetylation critically determines T cell subset radiosensitivity.,"Lymphocytes are sensitive to ionizing radiation and naive lymphocytes are more radiosensitive than their memory counterparts. Less is known about radiosensitivity of memory cell subsets. We examined the radiosensitivity of naive (TN), effector memory (TEM), and central memory (TCM) T cell subsets in C57BL/6 mice and found TEM to be more resistant to radiation-induced apoptosis than either TN or TCM. Surprisingly, we found no correlation between the extent of radiation-induced apoptosis in T cell subsets and 1) levels of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members or 2) the H2AX content and maximal gamma H2AX fold change. Rather, TEM cell survival correlated with higher levels of immediate gamma H2AX marking, immediate break binding and genome-wide open chromatin structure. T cells were able to mark DNA damage seemingly instantly (30 s), even if kept on ice. Relaxing chromatin with the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid following radiation or etoposide treatment improved the survival of TCM and TN cells up to levels seen in the resistant TEM cells but did not improve survival from caspase-mediated apoptosis. We conclude that an open genome-wide chromatin state is the key determinant of efficient immediate repair of DNA damage in T cells, explaining the observed T cell subset radiosensitivity differences."
1218,3365,,,,SDY659,,,"Contrasting effects of chronic, systemic treatment with mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and metformin on adult neural progenitors in mice","The chronic and systemic administration of rapamycin extends life span in mammals. Rapamycin is a pharmacological inhibitor of mTOR. Metformin also inhibits mTOR signaling but by activating the upstream kinase AMPK. Here we report the effects of chronic and systemic administration of the two mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin and metformin, on adult neural stem cells of the subventricular region and the dendate gyrus of the mouse hippocampus. While rapamycin decreased the number of neural progenitors, metformin-mediated inhibition of mTOR had no such effect. Adult-born neurons are considered important for cognitive and behavioral health, and may contribute to improved health span. Our results demonstrate that distinct approaches of inhibiting mTOR signaling can have significantly different effects on organ function. These results underscore the importance of screening individual mTOR inhibitors on different organs and physiological processes for potential adverse effects that may compromise health span."

1222,3365,,,,SDY663,,,Self-recognition drives the preferential accumulation of promiscuous CD4+ T-cells in aged mice,"T-cell recognition of self and foreign peptide antigens presented in MHC molecules (pMHC) is essential for life-long immunity. How the ability of the CD4+ T-cell compartment to bind self- and foreign-pMHC changes over the lifespan remains a fundamental aspect of T-cell biology that is largely unexplored. We report that, while old mice (18-22 months) contain fewer CD4+ T-cells compared with adults (8-12 weeks), those that remain have a higher intrinsic affinity for self-pMHC, as measured by CD5 expression. Old mice also have more cells that bind individual or multiple distinct foreign-pMHCs, and the fold increase in pMHC-binding populations is directly related to their CD5 levels. These data demonstrate that the CD4+ T-cell compartment preferentially accumulates promiscuous constituents with age as a consequence of higher affinity T-cell receptor interactions with self-pMHC."

The dysfunctions of adaptive B and T cells are well documented but the effect of aging on innate immunity remains incompletely understood. Using a heterogeneous population of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we first undertook transcriptional profiling and found that PBMCs isolated from old individuals (>= 65 yrs) exhibited a delayed and altered response to stimulation with TLR4, TLR7/8, and RIG-I agonists compared to cells obtained from adults (<= 40 yrs). This delayed response to innate immune agonists resulted in the reduced production of pro-inflammatory and antiviral cytokines and chemokines including TNFa, IL-6, IL-1b, IFNg, IFNa, CCL2 and CCL7. While the major monocyte and dendritic cell subsets did not change numerically with aging, activation of specific cell types was altered. PBMCs from old subjects also had a lower frequency of CD40+ monocytes, impaired up-regulation of PD-L1 on monocytes and T cells and increased expression of PD-L2 and B7-H4 on B cells. The defective immune response to innate agonists adversely affected adaptive immunity as TLR-stimulated PBMCs (minus CD3 T cells) from old subjects elicited significantly lower levels of adult T cell proliferation than those from adult subjects in an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Collectively, these age-associated changes in cytokine, chemokine and interferon production, as well as co-stimulatory protein expression could contribute to the blunted memory B and T cell immune responses to vaccines and infections."

1274,2014,,,,SDY95,,,Host Differences in influenza-specific CD4 T cell and B cell responses are modulated by viral strain and route of immunization,"The antibody response to influenza infection is largely dependent on CD4 T cell help for B cells. Cognate signals and secreted factors provided by CD4 T cells drive B cell activation and regulate antibody isotype switching for optimal antiviral activity. Recently, we analyzed HLA-DR1 transgenic (DR1) mice and C57BL/10 (B10) mice after infection with influenza virus A/New Caledonia/20/99 (NC) and defined epitopes recognized by virus-specific CD4 T cells. Using this information in the current study, we demonstrate that the pattern of secretion of IL-2, IFN-g, and IL-4 by CD4 T cells activated by NC infection is largely independent of epitope specificity and the magnitude of the epitope-specific response. Interestingly, however, the characteristics of the virus-specific CD4 T cell and the B cell response to NC infection differed in DR1 and B10 mice. The response in B10 mice featured predominantly IFN-g-secreting CD4 T cells and strong IgG2b/IgG2c production. In contrast, in DR1 mice most CD4 T cells secreted IL-2 and IgG production was IgG1-biased. Infection of DR1 mice with influenza PR8 generated a response that was comparable to that in B10 mice, with predominantly IFN-g-secreting CD4 T cells and greater numbers of IgG2c than IgG1 antibody-secreting cells. The response to intramuscular vaccination with inactivated NC was similar in DR1 and B10 mice; the majority of CD4 T cells secreted IL-2 and most IgG antibody-secreting cells produced IgG2b or IgG2c. Our findings identify inherent host influences on characteristics of the virus-specific CD4 T cell and B cell responses that are restricted to the lung environment. Furthermore, we show that these host influences are substantially modulated by the type of infecting virus via the early induction of innate factors. Our findings emphasize the importance of immunization strategy for demonstrating inherent host differences in CD4 T cell and B cell responses."
