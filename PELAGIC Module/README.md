# PELAGIC Module 

The PELAGIC Module is a software module designed for querying OSEAN DB and processing data.

This module includes: 
- A Python wrapper Pure_SPARQL was used by the paper to generate the Supplemental File 1; 
- A PELAGIC library of functions that can be used as template to input code to query OSEAN DB.


Links to use case specific PELAGIC methods:
- OSEAN-VIGET-DB methods used the Pure_SPARQL to look through different functions.
- PELAGIC library contains functions to be called for other programs or for users working with OSEAN DB.
