## Data used 

The first OSEAN DB developed was called OSEAN-VIGET, which converted the data from the VIGET3 (Vaccine Immune Gene Expression Tool) program to the SEA CDM format. Specifically, two VIGET input files were extracted from the VIGET Zenodo website (https://zenodo.org/records/7407195), with one about the metadata of 28 vaccine immune studies, and the other being the normalized gene expression data file. A Python ETL program was developed to process the metadata file to the SEA CDM format. The gene expression data file was downloaded to a local directory pointed by the SEA CDM documentation.
