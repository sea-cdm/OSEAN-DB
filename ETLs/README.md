# OSEAN-DB ETL programs

We have developed a list of ETL programs, dedicated for individual use cases.
The SEA_Templates.py script contains a function that will generate dataframes matching the SEA-CDM entries to load into OSEAN-DB.

## Usage of ETL:
- The SEA_Templates.py was modified into database specific ETL programs, which are found in the other directories.  
- Osean_Viget_ETL.py: Generated to convert VIGET into SEA CDM format, included as part of  OSEAN-CELLxGENE-DB folder.
- Osean_ImmPort_ETL.py: Generated to convert ImmPort into SEA CDM format, included as part of OSEAN-ImmPort-DB folder.
- Osean_CxG_ETL.py ETL: Generated to convert VIGET into SEA CDM format, included as part of OSEAN-VIGET-DB folder.
